    <h2>Ingredients (makes 10-12 Doughnuts)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        300g (10.6oz) of sieved plain flour (plus a little more for dusting)
      </li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>50g (1.7oz) of melted butter</li>
      <li>35g (1.2oz) of caster sugar</li>
      <li>1/4tsp of salt</li>
      <li>
        1tbsp of 40% alcohol or stronger (makes them more crunchy but you can
        skip if you like)
      </li>
      <li>125ml of lukewarm milk</li>
      <li>10g (0.35oz) of fresh yeast or 5g (0.17oz) of dry yeast</li>
      <li>1L of vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 small jar of raspberry jam for stuffing</li>
      <li>Icing sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine yeast with lukewarm milk and leave to activate for around 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix all the remaining ingredients with yeast and milk mixture adding
        melted butter at the end. Work the dough for a few minutes until smooth
        in touch (the dough will be sticky to start with, do not add any more
        flour) you can use a stand mixer with a hook attachment for this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough to a ball and rest in the metal bowl covered with cloth
        in a warm place until doubles in size (around 1,5h) If the ambient room
        temperature is low, warm up the bowl with hot water as this will help to
        speed up the process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the dough from a bowl and work with your hand for a couple of
        minutes to knock back the air.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 10 or 12 balls and allow to prove for the second
        time for 25 minutes covered with a cloth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the doughnuts are almost ready to be fried, preheat the oil to 175C
        (350F).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry doughnuts on each side until nicely browned and stuff with jam while
        warm by using a piping bag and noozle.
      </li>
      <li>Dust with icing sugar ready to be served.</li>
    </ol>
