    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken (I used half chicken thighs, half
        chicken tenders but use whatever is on sale!)
      </li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>4 large carrots, peeled and large-diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dry thyme</li>
      <li>10 cups water</li>
      <li>3/4 cup white rice (I used short grain)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the chicken
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pat the chicken dry and dice it into cubes. You'll break it apart
            later with a fork, so it doesn't have to be perfect.
          </li>
          <li>Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Brown the chicken
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large soup pot over medium-high.
            Cook the chicken in batches for 3–5 minutes on each side until
            browned all over. Transfer it to a plate.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the aromatics
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the pot seems too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion
            and carrots and cook for 5–6 minutes. Add the thyme and cook 1
            minute more. Season with salt and pepper.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the soup
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add the chicken back to the pot and cover with water. Bring to a
            boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and hard simmer for 30–40
            minutes until cooked through. Shred with a fork after it's tender if
            you like. You can also leave the pieces whole if you don't feel like
            fussing with breaking the chicken apart. Season the broth liberally
            with salt and pepper.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the rice
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bring the soup back to a boil. Add the rice and reduce heat to
            medium-low. Hard simmer for 30 minutes until tender. The broth
            should reduce down and be pretty rich at this point.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can add a bit more water in 1/2 cup increments if the rice
            absorbs too much liquid!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish the soup:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stir in the dill and taste the broth and season to your preferences.
            Turn off the heat.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        To serve
        <ol>
          <li>
            Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more dill if you like.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
